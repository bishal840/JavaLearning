JDK--> JRE--> JVM

class can have 5 access modifiers--> public , default, final, abstract, strictfp
There can be only one public class in a source file and the file name must be class name.
There can be many non public class in a source file and the file name can have any name if no public class.
After compilation, .class file will be generated for each is class in the source file

Object is created by JVM in Heap area
JVM starts Garbage Collection to clear out objects which don't have reference variable attached to it

String s1 =”Bishal”  ---> in scp(after checking if not present in scp)
String s = new String(“Bishal”) ---> in Heap(definitely) as well as in scp(after checking if not present in scp)
System.out.println(10+s1+15+s2); -->10Bishal15Bishal
System.out.println(10+15+s1+s2); -->25BishalBishal
System.out.println(s1+10*15+s2); -->Bishal150Bishal
